# Introduction
A simple web application to share files using socket.io library.

The origin of this project is the following youtube video: [Create Real-time File Sharing App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS & Socket.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtiD7Y__32M).

I should have fork the original source code but I couldn't find it.

# Start

Use `make` to build or run the project. Example: `make run`
